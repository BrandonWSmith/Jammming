<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need the latest version of Node.js and Node Package Manager to run this project.

You can install the latest version of Node at <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Nodejs.org</a>.

You can install the latest version of NPM by running:
 ```sh
 npm install npm@latest -g
 ```

You will also need a Spotify client ID. To obtain a Spotify client ID, you will need to login to <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/">Spotify for Developers</a> using your Spotify account. Once logged in, navigate to the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard">dashboard</a> and click "Create app" in the top right corner.

On the app creation page, you can enter any name and description you wish. For the redirect URIs, enter `http://localhost:3000/app/callback`, this URL must be listed for the app to correctly redirect back from the Spotify authorizartion page.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To start the app, run:
 ```sh
 npm start
 ```
Once the app has started, a browser window should open automatically. If your browser does not open automatically, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

You will first see a landing page that prompts you to enter your Spotify client ID. Enter the client ID found in the settings page for your Spotify app listed in your <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard">Spotify Dashboard</a>.

Upon submitting your client ID, you will be redirected to a Spotify authorization page. Agree to authorize Jammming to access your Spotify account and you will be redirected back to the Jammming app.

On the left side of the app, you can search for songs, artists or albums listed on Spotify.

<div align="center">

</div>
</br></br>

Search results can be added to a playlist by clicking the "+" icon which will add the song to the playlist on the right side of the app.

<div align="center">

At the top of the playlist section, you can name your playlist and save it to your Spotify account.
